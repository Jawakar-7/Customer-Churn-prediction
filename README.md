# Protium_Assignment
Predictive Objective: The main objective of your project is to predict whether an applicant will default on their loan or credit obligation. This is a binary classification problem, where 'Default' is the target variable, taking on values of 0 (no default) and 1 (default).
Risk Assessment:

our project is concerned with assessing the risk associated with lending to individuals or entities. The features in the dataset are used to determine the creditworthiness of applicants, helping financial institutions make informed decisions about whether to approve or deny credit applications.

Techniques and Algorithms:

Feature Engineering: I have performed feature engineering to preprocess and extract relevant information from the dataset. This could include transforming, encoding, or creating new features.
Binary Classification: our project is framed as a binary classification task, which means I have  employed classification algorithms to make predictions. It's common in credit risk assessment to use machine learning models to evaluate applicants' creditworthiness.

Data Analysis:

The project likely involved extensive data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's characteristics and gain insights into the features and their relationships.
Boosting Algorithms:

Boosting algorithms, an ensemble learning technique, have been utilized in our project. These algorithms are known for improving classification models' performanceâ€”some boosting algorithms like  CatBoost. Boosting algorithms combine the results of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to create a robust predictive model.

Model Evaluation:

Model evaluation would have been a crucial part of your project. I Have used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score to assess the performance of our predictive model.


Since Random forest regressor Gives the most accuracy I have selected that model.
the model selection python file where I use GridSearch to asses the best parameters has not been attached since the zip file exceeds the maximum file size 10 mb.
Thankyou for providing this oppurtunity.
